    <h1>JAVASCRIPT PROGRAM TO DEMONSTRATE VAR , LET AND CONSTANT.</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p> var : Var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. 
        This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.</p>

    <p>let : Let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement,
         or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, 
         or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.</p>
 
    <p>const : Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. 
        const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
        const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.</p>
