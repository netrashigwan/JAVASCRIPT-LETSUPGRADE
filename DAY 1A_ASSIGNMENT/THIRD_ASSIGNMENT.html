    <h3>A. Primitive Datatypes</h3>
    <p>1. Number - The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

        There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.</p>
        
       <p>2. String - A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
    
        Double quotes: "Hello".
        Single quotes: 'Hello'.
        Backticks: `Hello`.
        Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.
        
        Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}</p>
       <p>3. Boolean - The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
    
        This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.</p>
       <p>4. Null - The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.
    
        It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value.</p>
       <p>5. Undefined - The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.
    
        The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
        
        If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined.</p>
    
        <h3>B. Non-primitive Datatypes</h3>
    
    
        <p>1. Objects and Symbols - The object type is special.
    
            All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). 
            In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
            The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.
             We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.</p>
